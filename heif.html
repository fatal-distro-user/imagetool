            <p>HEIF (High Efficiency Image File) is a modern image format often used alongside HEIC (for iPhone).

                📌 What does it mean?

                Stores photos more efficiently than JPEG

                Can store transparency, animation, and multiple images in one file

                Lossy or lossless possible

                📌 Advantages:

                Smaller files with the same quality as JPEG

                Supports modern features like Live Photos or multiple exposures

                📌 Disadvantages:

                Not compatible everywhere → older devices and software often can't read it directly

                Conversion needed for editing

                📌 Oldschool Fact:
                HEIF/HEIC is the modern answer to JPEG, developed in the 2010s to save storage space and expand features.

                Rule of thumb:
                📱 Smartphone / modern photos → HEIF/HEIC
                🌐 Web / old devices → JPEG/PNG</p>
